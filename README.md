## Overview

This project explores the detection of fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, with a focus on word embeddings and deep learning. By utilizing **GloVe word embeddings** for vectorization and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** for model development, the goal is to accurately classify news articles as true or fake. The model's performance is evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and visualizations like word clouds.

## Introduction

Fake news has become a significant challenge in the digital age, spreading misinformation that can impact public opinion and society. The goal of this project is to build an automated system that can identify fake news articles using NLP and machine learning techniques. By leveraging **GloVe word embeddings** and an **LSTM model**, this project aims to create an efficient and scalable solution for fake news detection.

## Data

The dataset used for this project consists of news articles labeled as **true** or **fake**. The data is preprocessed to clean the text and convert it into a format suitable for model training. You can find the dataset and the details of its structure within the notebook. You can also replace it with your own dataset if you wish to experiment further.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Text data is cleaned by removing stop words, punctuation, and applying stemming/lemmatization.
   
2. **GloVe Word Embeddings:**
   - Pre-trained GloVe embeddings are used to convert text into dense vector representations of words, capturing semantic relationships between words.
   
3. **Model Development (LSTM):**
   - An **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** model is built to capture the sequential dependencies in the text and classify it as true or fake news.
   
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The model's performance is evaluated using the following:
     - **Accuracy & Loss Plots**: Visualize training/testing accuracy and loss over epochs.
     - **Confusion Matrix**: Analyze the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
     - **Word Cloud**: Visual representation of the most frequent words in fake and true news articles.

## Results

- **Accuracy & Loss Plots**: These plots show how well the model is performing over time during training and evaluation. The accuracy increases as the model learns, while the loss decreases.
  
- **Confusion Matrix**: The confusion matrix is generated to assess the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model, providing deeper insights into its classification performance.
  
- **Word Cloud**: A word cloud is created to visualize the most frequent words in fake and true news articles, offering insights into patterns and word usage in both categories.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how NLP techniques like **GloVe embeddings** and deep learning methods like **LSTM** can be used effectively for fake news detection. The model achieved reasonable accuracy, but challenges like data imbalance and subtle differences in language still pose difficulties. 

### Future Work:
- **Model Enhancement**: Incorporating more advanced architectures like **BERT** could improve accuracy.
- **Data Expansion**: Using a more diverse and balanced dataset will likely improve model generalization.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Implementing the model for real-time fake news detection on news websites and social media.
